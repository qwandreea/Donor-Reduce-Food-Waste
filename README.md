# Reduce Food Waste - Donor

## Brief description
The idea behind this project stemmed from the observation that a significant quantity of purchased food products ends up being discarded right from one's own household, without a readily available method for reusing them for charitable purposes or even for saving or recovering a certain amount of money.

The objective of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly application that stores information about food products in a suitable condition for donation or optional purchase at a greatly reduced price, and then redistributes them to organizations, food banks, or individuals in need, following a sustainable approach.

Donor takes into account several stakeholders who can benefit from the functionalities provided: users, businesses, and volunteers
